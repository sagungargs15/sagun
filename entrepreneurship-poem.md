> hmm..CHOCOLATE, thatâ€™s not CANDY..hmm..
> IF I **build** the candy machine, I get to EAT ALL THE CANDY ğŸ¤©
(Itâ€™s backwards, build something customers want, build something you want as your own user)

### meanwhile..the kid cried give me the candy (get's rehearsed with vigor)

> hmm..DEVELOPER MACHINE, thatâ€™s not CANDY MACHINE..hmm..
> IF I **learn** the candy man, I can CANDY THE CHOCOLATE ğŸ¤©
(Fail fast. Lack of product market fit reinforces pivoting your startup )

### meanwhile..the kid  cried give me the candy (get's rehearsed with vigor)

> Hmm.. HANDYMAN, thatâ€™s not CANDY MAN..hmm..
> IF I **re-build** the candy machine, I can MAKE THE_CANDY ğŸ¤©
