```
**â€”â€”Start of Infinite loopâ€”â€”**
```

### meanwhile..the kid cried give me the ***CANDY!!!*** ^^

> hmm.. **CHOCOLATE** ^^^, thatâ€™s not **CANDY!!!** ..hmm..
  IF I **build** the candy machine, I get to **EAT ALL THE CANDY** ðŸ¤©

*(Itâ€™s backwards, build something customers want, build something you want as your own user)*


### meanwhile..the kid cried give me the ***CANDY!!!*** ^^

> hmm.. **DEVELOPER MACHINE** ^^^, thatâ€™s not **CANDY MACHINE** ..hmm..
  IF I **learn** the candy man, I can **CANDY THE CHOCOLATE** ðŸ¤©

*(Fail fast. Lack of product market fit reinforces pivoting your everything)*


### meanwhile..the kid  cried give me the ***CANDY!!!*** ^^

> hmm.. **HANDYMAN** ^^^, thatâ€™s not **CANDY MAN** ..hmm.. 
  IF I **re-build** the candy machine, I can **MAKE THE CANDY** ðŸ¤©

*(Redo whatâ€™s not working in the startup: team, product & market)*

### meanwhile..the kid  cried give me the ***CANDY!!!***

```
**â€”â€”â€”  loop again â€”â€”**
```

> At the end of the day what matters? **Step1**: "Build -> Learn (Works?)" **Step2**: "Repeat step1" - said every Entrepreneur
