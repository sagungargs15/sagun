# My Angel Investment Thesis: Sagun Garg
- **Geo**: US focussed startups only (More liquid secondaries and mature ecosystem: capital, founders and exits)
- **Stage**: Early Stage: Gives Horizon 2 & Horizon 3 insights into the sector and also Alpha in ROI to make up losers in the portfolio
- **Sector(s)**: Bitcoin, AI/ML+ DevTools and SpaceTech
- **Expert Practitioner**: Repeat Founders/Experienced Operators - Understand PMF, O-1 phase and Product building, more focussed on Distribution, Market and 
- **Traction Positive**: No revenue is fine but signals from a deployed MVP is a must
- **Native to Internet**: Unfair advantage natively digital or cyberspace. 
- **Veto Call**: It should be special in the sense it should follow the Power Law of returning the fund if it was the lone winner in my portfolio
