title: "Half Marathons"

## I have trained and participated in Half Marathons for more than 5+ yrs.

My reasons to train and run for Half Marathons:
  - Finish Line: The finish line after 21kms or 42 kms isn't just a physical marker; itâ€™s a testimony to the unwavering commitment, determination and unyielding human conviction of completing a milestone under constraints
  - Fun: Enjoy the atmosphere around a group run where social running you outdo individual performance on the run day
  - Fitness: Celebrate & test my basic fitness
