## [About](https://sagungarg.com/about) my expertise: CTO/Founder: [Sagun](https://x.com/sagungarg). You can also find me on linkedin [Sagun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagungarg)

**Entrepreneurship[(poem)](https://sagungarg.com/0-poem) for me is multiple hats in one Go: Selling to stakeholders, Resource mobilization & Skewed skills (Polyglot: Programmer in 7+ languages, System Architect, Engineering Manager, Product Owner, Product Manager & DevOps Expert).**

- üó£ **Brief**: Currently serving as Global Innovation Director - Software Engineering  & Enterprise Architecture at Bank Julius Baer. In my past life I have been a [repeat](https://sagungarg.com/1-previous-startups) Founder/CTO with 3 x startups [DevTool, CareerTech, PropTech] built with AI/ML to craft data products specially in architectures that are characterised by time-series, textual, geospatial, bigdata, nosql & erratic nature of data. I have also played couple of stints of CTO-on-Hire to turn around two(2) pre-Series A startups in Singapore & Hong Kong respectively.
