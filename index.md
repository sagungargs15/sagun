## Attitude to others: I like to Empower promising folks with fire in the belly

Regardless of what we discover,
we understand and truly believe that
everyone did the best job they could,
given what they knew at the time,
their skills and abilities,
the resources available,
and the situation at hand.


TL;DR 

Just be nice.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
