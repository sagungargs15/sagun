Thiel: “Almost all of the successful companies in Silicon Valley had some model of starting with small markets and expanding.”

Amazon started with books. 
PayPal started with eBay power-sellers. 
Facebook started with Harvard. 
Airbnb started with renting air mattresses.
Tesla started with high-end electric sports cars.
