## How to to approach Machine Learning Problems.

1. Define the Problem
2. Prepare Data
3. Spot Check Algorithms
4. Improve Results
5. Present Results
 
## Machine learning involves[Check this article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/process-for-working-through-machine-learning-problems/)

1. data & data pipelines, 
2. model training & tuning (i.e., experiments), 
3. governance,
4. specialized tools for deployment, 
5. monitoring and observability


## Kickass ML/AI Tools

**WEKA**
- Start with Weka, the workbench for Machine Learning.
- Weka will let you apply a lot of different algorithms to your data without writing a single line of code.
- Even better: Weka will generate code for you!

**HYDRA(hydra.cc)**
- With Hydra, you can compose your configuration dynamically, enabling you to easily get the perfect configuration for each run. 
- You can override everything from the command line, which makes experimentation fast, and removes the need to maintain multiple similar configuration files.
