## Bitcoin: Store of Value digitally like Gold

Humans behaviourly value scarcity
Digital Scarcity: Human's love to fuck with Scarcity because they have financial incentives skewed to do so. 
Currency debasement is a technique used by central banks to set off debt/leverage created in the financial system
Bitcoin is scarce with a pre-detrmined supply curve - limited number 21 million coins
Unlike Gold, bitcoin is additionally a network and technology on internet which is divisible which makes adoption faster
Money at the end of the day is story/fictions we tell ourseleves and it only has if we as human collectively believe in it has value
Bitcoin also runs the risk of becoming nothing
As, digitisation of economic value spreads,  Bitcoin 21 million units become hyper-scarce hence hyper valuable
