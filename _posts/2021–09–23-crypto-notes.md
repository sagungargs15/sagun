Humans behaviourly value scarcity
Digital Scarcity: Human's love to fuck with Scarcity because they have financial incentives skewed to do so. 
Currency debasement is a technique used by central banks to set off debt/leverage created in the financial system
Bitcoin is scarce with a pre-detrmined supply curve - limited number 21 million coins
Unlike Gold, bitcoin is additionally a network and technology on internet which is divisible which makes adoption faster
Money at the end of the day is story/fictions we tell ourseleves and it only has if we as human collectively believe in it has value
