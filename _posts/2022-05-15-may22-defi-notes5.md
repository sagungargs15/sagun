# My notes on DEFI

1. **Chainlink Price Feeds:** In a single call get real-world market prices of assets for your smart contracts. Chainlink aims to provide tamper-proof inputs and outputs of data for smart contracts on any blockchain e.g. Using Chainlink Price Feeds, increasing or decreasing the supply of coin1 to match demand with supply and maintain a 1:1 peg with coin2
2. **Chainlink Keepers:**



# Why pick Chainlink as a price oracle solution ?
1. Its infrastructure is seamless to integrate and time-tested in production. 
2. Chainlink already helps secure leading DeFi protocols responsible for tens of billions of dollars in smart contract value, maintaining robust security and high availability even amidst unexpected events, such as exchange downtime, flash crashes, and data manipulation attacks via flash loans.
