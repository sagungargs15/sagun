# 4 Types of Learners
Often communication is about education. I learn by mostly reading words. The four most common learning types of adults, often referred to as learning styles, are: 

1. **Visual Learners**: Prefer learning through seeing and visualizing concepts using images, charts, graphs, and diagrams. 

2. **Auditory Learners**: Learn best through listening, such as lectures, discussions, or podcasts. 

3. **Reading/Writing Learners**: Prefer learning through reading text and writing notes, often benefiting from manuals, lists, and written instructions. 

4. **Kinesthetic Learners**: Learn best through hands-on experiences and physical activities, preferring to engage in practical tasks or experiments. 

These learning styles are often categorized under the VARK model, which helps guide teaching and learning strategies based on individual preferences. Presentations are prefered for some people.
