# What is the Taproot Upgrade
Taproot is a protocol upgrade introduced in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 341. It was developed to enhance Bitcoin’s privacy, scalability, and flexibility in transactions. Taproot extends Bitcoin's capabilities and combines the Schnorr signature scheme with Merkleized Alternative Script Trees (MAST), and provides a new scripting language known as Tapscript.

## Top 15 Quotes on Taproot Upgrade

> "Taproot improves the sustainability of bitcoin by increasing the data density of transactions, unlocks more complexity (while improving privacy) in conditional transactions, and proves that bitcoin upgrades can still work!"

> "With Taproot, complex multisig transactions will look identical to regular P2PKH transactions, significantly enhancing privacy on the network." - This reflects the consensus among developers on how Taproot changes transaction visibility.

> "The introduction of Schnorr signatures in Taproot allows for signature aggregation, making multisig transactions cheaper and less data-intensive." - Thsi addresses cost of transaction i.e fees 

> "Taproot’s main goal is to make more complex transactions indistinguishable from simpler ones, enhancing privacy and reducing the traceability of Bitcoin transactions." - This encapsulates the privacy aspect of Taproot.

> "By implementing Schnorr signatures, Taproot introduces a way to combine multiple signatures into one, significantly reducing the size and cost of transactions." - A key technical benefit highlighted by Bitcoin developers.

> "Taproot enables a future where we can have smart contracts on Bitcoin that are as efficient and private as possible, without increasing the blockchain size unnecessarily." - Reflects the smart contract potential with Taproot.

> "Taproot uses Merkle trees to only reveal the executed path of a transaction, which not only saves block space but also adds a layer of privacy." - This discusses the MAST (Merkle Abstract Syntax Tree) feature of Taproot.

> "The upgrade allows for script path spending, where the spending conditions of a transaction are only revealed once the funds are spent, enhancing privacy." - Again paraphrasing the privacy aspects of Taproot

>"With Taproot, Bitcoin can now handle more sophisticated financial applications like sidechains, atomic swaps, and even more complex smart contracts without the network overhead." - Highlighting the scalability benefits.

> "Taproot's implementation of Schnorr signatures not only streamlines the verification process but also paves the way for future scalability solutions like Lightning Network to become even more efficient." - This quote underlines the synergy between Taproot and Lightning Network advancements.

> 🥕 Taproot will make opening & closing ⚡️ channels more private & enables clever ways of transaction batching, potentially good for privacy & scalability."

> "What’s particularly fascinating about Taproot’s approach is that it aligns individual economic incentives (paying less in fees) with increased privacy for all users" 

> "The Taproot upgrade will translate to an overall smoother user experience and roll out the red carpet for vast innovation on the #Bitcoin network."

> "Taproot matters, because it opens a breadth of opportunity for entrepreneurs interested in expanding bitcoin's utility,"

## More Details on Taproot

1. Increased Efficiency and Cost Reduction: Taproot increases transaction efficiency and reduces costs. By allowing users to combine several transactions into one, Taproot can save space on the blockchain, thereby allowing more transactions to fit into a block. This feature results in lower transaction fees and faster transaction times, improving the overall user experience. 

    - **Signature Aggregation**: Schnorr signatures allow for signature aggregation. In a multi-signature transaction, instead of including each signature separately, all the signatures can be combined into a single signature. This aggregation reduces the size of transactions on the blockchain, freeing up space and making transactions faster and cheaper.
    - **Batch Verification**: Schnorr signatures allow for batch verification. That is, verifying a batch of signatures all at once is faster than verifying each signature individually. 

2. Expansion of smart contract use cases: With Taproot developers can create more flexible and complex smart contracts on the network, expanding the use cases. By utilizing MAST and the new Tapscript scripting language, developers can create multi-condition contracts, improving the functionality without revealing unnecessary details on the blockchain.

3. Security: Schnorr signature scheme offers robust security and has been widely studied. It is provably non-malleable and does not suffer from the same vulnerabilities as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) used in the network prior to Taproot

    - **Non-malleability**:  is a property of cryptographic systems that ensures that if a third party changes an encrypted message, the resulting decryption will not be meaningful. This is a vital property for a digital signature scheme where we want to ensure that if a signature is modified in any way, it won't validate under any public key. Prior to Taproot, Bitcoin used the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECDSA has a potential malleability issue where an attacker could alter a valid signature into another valid signature for the same public key and message. This doesn't directly lead to a loss of funds in the network, but it can complicate tracking of transactions and potentially be used in certain types of attacks. Schnorr signatures, on the other hand, are provably non-malleable under standard cryptographic assumptions. This means that if a Schnorr signature is changed in any way, it will not validate under the original public key.

    - **Security Proofs**: Schnorr signatures come with a security proof under the discrete logarithm problem, meaning that breaking Schnorr signatures is as hard as solving this well-studied mathematical problem. On the other hand, ECDSA, while believed to be secure, does not have a proof of security under similar assumptions. This doesn't mean ECDSA is insecure - in fact, it has held up very well to cryptographic scrutiny - but having a proof gives us additional confidence in the security of Schnorr signatures.

    - **Reduced Vulnerability**: Schnorr signatures reduce certain vulnerabilities that exist in the ECDSA scheme. For example, in ECDSA, if the same 'k' value (a random value used in the signature generation process) is used for two different messages with the same private key, an attacker can compute the private key. This has led to actual losses of funds when poor random number generators were used. Schnorr signatures, on the other hand, have a built-in way to derive the 'k' value deterministically from the message and private key, eliminating this risk.

    - **Linearity**: Schnorr signatures are linear, which allows for easy construction of multisignatures - a single signature that validates a transaction from multiple signers. This is more space-efficient than the equivalent construct with ECDSA, and also simpler, reducing the potential for implementation errors that could compromise security.

## Conclusion
Schnorr signature scheme offers several important security benefits compared to ECDSA, including non-malleability, provable security, reduced vulnerability to certain types of attacks, and linearity, making it a robust choice for the security of the transactions. As a result, Taproot improves transaction privacy, increases efficiency, reduces costs, and offers more robust security. 

# What is the Tapscript

![pic](https://sagungarg.com/assets/img/log-post-images/blog-july24-tapscript-script-miniscript.png)

Script (uppercase S, also Bitcoin Script) is the scripting language used in Bitcoin. Its programs are called "scripts" (lowercase s), often with an adjective based on the location of the script in a transaction (output script, input script, redeem script, witness script, leaf script).

Leaf script is a script revealed as part of a Taproot (SegWit v1) script path spend (see [BIP341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki)).

Tapscript is a variant of Script used in leaf scripts with a leaf version of 0xc0 (see [BIP342](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki)). It makes some significant changes to previously used Script, such as switching from ECDSA to Schnorr signatures, replacing OP_CHECKMULTISIG(VERIFY) with OP_CHECKSIGADD and introducing OP_SUCCESS opcodes for better upgradeability. 

Tapscript scripts are often called "tapscripts".

[Miniscript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) is a language for writing scripts that enables composition, static analysis and more. It compiles directly to Script (or Tapscript).
