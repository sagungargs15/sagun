**If you were General Manager of the Experiences business for TripAdvisor (https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions) for destinations in the United States, what are the metrics you would have on your daily dashboard in order of importance? (Most people give us at least 10, but not more than 20).**

## Broadly 4 KPIs 
In this case (my rule of thumb is not more than 3, a figure I can always mentally track) but since you insist I decided to further expand it to sub categories which gives a better understanding of the health of the attractions experiences platform with the luxury of a dashboard to get detailed insights of depending what we want to optimise it for.
