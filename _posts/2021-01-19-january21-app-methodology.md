# (Architectural) Platform Vs App Patterns ?

## Year 2013 (Platform Design Pattern - Heroku)

[Twelve factor](https://12factor.net/) isn’t a set of ideas about how to build web apps. It’s a description of a platform. 12factor.net, created in Year 2013 by the folks at [Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/twelve-factor-apps), is a guide/best-practices for creating microservices based applications for modern cloud. 

It distills best practices for building modern cloud applications into a 12-factor methodology specifically designed to maximize developer productivity and application maintainability.

Twelve Factor apps are built for agility and rapid deployment, enabling continuous delivery and reducing the time and cost for new developers to join a project. At the same time, they are architected to exploit the principles of modern cloud platforms while permitting maximum portability...

What’s a platform? A platform is a suite of functionality that offers a consistent contract to the applications that run on it. Viewed in this light, I began to understand much of twelve factor more deeply. For example I originally thought the declaration that “The twelve-factor app stores config in environment variables” was wrong, because I didn’t like environment variables. Now I understand that it means: “The platform will make available any configuration values stored with it in the application’s POSIX environment”.

This was a fundamentally different way of looking at it, and I didn’t recognize it at first, because almost no one deploying a web application has a platform built for that purpose today, unless you use Heroku’s or work someplace large like Twitter or Google. The platform most people are building on is “Linux” and that’s not designed to solve their problems.


## Year 2019 (App Design Pattern - Hasura)

[3factor app](https://3factor.app/) is an architecture pattern for modern fullstack apps. The 3factor name is inspired from 12factor.net. 3factor apps are fast to build and are highly scalable. Although the name is similar, 3factor.app is actually an application design pattern. This is application design pattern proposed by [Hasura](https://hasura.io/blog/build-a-realtime-mobile-chat-app-using-3factor-architecture/)
