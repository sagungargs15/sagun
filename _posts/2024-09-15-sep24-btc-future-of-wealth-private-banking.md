> Bitcoin has potential as a medium of exchange in the future, its current and near-future value proposition is primarily as a store of value. Entrepreneurs in the space should focus on building products and services that cater to this use case.

# Bitcoin - Store of Value Vehicle (HODL):

1. **Bitcoin as Store of Value**:
   - The presenter argues that Bitcoin's primary use case currently is as a store of value, rather than a medium of exchange.
   - Store of value functionality is likely to precede widespread adoption as a medium of exchange.

2. **Adoption Curve**:
   - Bitcoin is still in the early adopter phase, with significant growth potential.
   - The presenter estimates that widespread adoption as a store of value could occur within the next 10 years.

3. **Market Potential**:
   - Bitcoin's current market cap is small compared to traditional assets (1.4 trillion vs. 900 trillion total global assets).
   - There's potential for Bitcoin to capture a significant portion of traditional asset value, possibly reaching $10 million per BTC.

4. **Wealth Transfer**:
   - A "demonetization" of traditional assets is occurring as Bitcoin gains value relative to other assets.
   - This represents a potential wealth transfer from traditional assets to Bitcoin.

5. **Opportunities for Entrepreneurs**:
   - The presenter encourages entrepreneurs to focus on building solutions for store of value use cases rather than payment solutions at this stage.
   - There are opportunities to create user-friendly custody solutions and services for wealthy individuals and institutions.

6. **Inheritance and Estate Planning**:
   - Bitcoin offers unique advantages for inheritance planning, including jurisdiction-independent transfers and time-locked transactions.

7. **Custody Solutions**:
   - There's a need for more user-friendly custody solutions that balance security with ease of use.
   - New digital private banks specializing in Bitcoin services are likely to emerge.

8. **Bitcoin as "Cyber Manhattan**:
   - The presenter draws an analogy between Bitcoin and Manhattan real estate, suggesting Bitcoin could become a premium, borderless store of value.

9. **Advice for Entrepreneurs**:
   - Understand the adoption curve and build for the current phase (store of value) rather than future use cases (medium of exchange).
   - Consider the needs of wealthy individuals and institutions when developing Bitcoin-related products and services.
