# Method of accounting (UTXO or Account based ledger)
1. **UTXO** - UTXO's are not tied to an account, accounts don't really exist in UTXO. It works similar to how cash is handled in your hand amongst friends or family(e.g.Bitcoin, Litecoin, Cardano and NEO)
2.**Account based ledger** - e.g. Ethereum,EOS and Tron uses an 'account' based method. It is much like traditional accounting in that a series of records have to be kept for each and every wallet (user). Literally a digital ledger. As it is account based it functions much like a bank account with a balance
