## Observations: My insights

> In an AI venture the amount of data assets (data pipelines, schemas, relationships and feature stores) that get generated are exponential with number of data-roles joining the org(i.e data scientists, data engineers, data analysts and database administrators) 

## Human Side of AI

**Machine Learning Vs Decision Intelligence**

- Decision intelligence (ML++)
- Machine Learning = "thing-labeling"

**Three of the key insights:**
1. There is a fundamental difference between building and applying Machine Learning algorithms.
2. The use of black-box machine learning models can be justified if you have a proper testing procedure in place.
3. Machine Learning will deliver to you what you ask for, not necessarily what you want. That’s why it’s crucial to be thoughtful about what you ask for.

### ML Process
1. Microwave VS kitchen, cook. You don't need first to build a microwave from scratch, then use it to cook. You just need knowing how use it, then do your cook. 
2.1 Ingredients -> Appliance -> recipe -> dish
2.2  Data ->  Algorithm -> Models -> predictions.
2.3  Building a large scale kitchen is different skill set, compared to build a microwave. 
3. ML is a new programming paradigm.Imagine what you want The Island(many smart people just working for you sitting behind screen) to do your repeated work.
3.1 ML research VS ML engineer, Algorithm research VS  Applied. 
4. you don't understand how your brain work ,how you recognize a cat. But it just work, that's OK. You don't need to do AL from scratch, just dive it , to use it.
5. Testing is vital.
