# Casa.io Inheritance

If your Recipient can use a smartphone, you can use Casa Inheritance

Casa Inheritance allows Casa members to securely share access to their cryptocurrency vaults with a designated recipient for generational wealth transfer. Members invite the recipient, share an encrypted mobile key, and after a 6-month waiting period or verification process, the recipient gains access using the mobile key and Casa's recovery key. This avoids needing hardware wallets or seed phrases, simplifying inheritance. Assets supported include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and USD Coin. The plan is available worldwide on Casa's Standard plan, with enhanced verification options for Private Clients with substantial holdings. It provides a streamlined way to pass on self-custodied crypto.   

## In 2-of-3 Multisig Setup
Bypassing hardware wallets reduces a major source of uncertainty with crypto inheritance: the device itself. We’ve heard cautionary tales of heirs and estate executors who couldn’t find a missing device, didn’t know how to use it, or didn’t have the PIN documented. There’s just no reason to add confusion to a time of bereavement if you can help it. We mentioned earlier that the family won’t necessarily need to use a hardware wallet. This streamlines the inheritance process considerably for families. Because this plan is built around a 3-key vault, the mobile key and Casa Recovery Key are all the Recipient needs for inheritance. 

## Casa Inheritance (Setup Process)
Here is the detailed overview of how it works with our 3-key vaults:-
1. Choose a Recipient and invite them to set up a free Casa account. 
2. Once they accept your invite, you’ll share your encrypted mobile key with them via QR code. This also designates their account as able to request a signature from the Casa Recovery Key for your vault. 
3. If/when the time comes, they can request access to your vault in the Casa app.
4. After a six-month waiting period, during which we give you plenty of reminders to tell us “I’m not dead!”, vault access is unlocked for your Recipient. 
5. They can now use the mobile key and the Casa Recovery Key, which Casa stores on your behalf, for transactions.
