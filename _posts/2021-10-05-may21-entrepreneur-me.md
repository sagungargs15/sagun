## Feedback after pitching to Stalwarts

> Gratitude - “It takes a Village to Raise an entrepreneur”

It took a village to raise me and shape me over the years, I am grateful and thankful for the feedback/ideas received from these stalwarts while I have pitched my ideas 1-1 when paths crossed or they showed active interest in my ventures.
