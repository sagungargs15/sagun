## Bootstrapper mindset is the new default:
> small & efficient teams
> organic growth & profitability
> less features & more focus
> pleasing the users instead of investors 
> automating is better than hiring

## The Age of Indie Hackers, Solopreneurs and Billion Dollar Unicorn by Solopreneurs:
Investors still want to own equity in these companies.
- bootstrapped founders will be selling their equity instead of raising money for the startup
- Someone who makes a marketplace for secondaries in bootstrapped (or VC backed, who don't plan to raise again) will make a huge upside.
- The rev-share models will surge, too, where investors won't buy equity but a % of the revenue.
- These secondaries will even turn into toekinized assets.
- Indie Makers will sell rev-share of their entire output. Not the company, but them as an individual. Imagine owning 1% of rev share of everything that Marc Loe, Pieter Levels or other good makers produce (not for life, e.g. for 5 years).
- VC money (unless u need to buy GPUs) will rather look negative on a startup than positive. YC will still be positive. It's not about the money, but rather a network and a "medal".
- Startup incubators will collapse as a business model, except top 1%. Being on X brings 100x more value than any average incubator.
- Holdcos will be the best new way to become rich.
I see them as little monopolies that aren't illegal (for now).
- Influencers will all ship lots of apps, sites, saas, marketplaces and other digital products (in addition to physical products, courses, events and things they did in the past).
- the bar to build and ship tech product is so low, one need no coding skills at all with tools like V0, Bolt, Replit, Cursor. At first we will see simple products being shipped this way, but it complexity will grow as the models improve.
- whitelabel model will have it's new renaissance. I bet on it myself. Have more than 10 partners working with me now to launch whitelabeled version of my tools to other markets or niches. 

Let's revisit this prediction in 20 months.
