> The key characteristics of Bitcoin as “freedom tech” relate to its decentralized, permissionless, and secure nature, providing users with greater autonomy over their wealth and transactions. 

## Characteristics of Bitcoin’s design:

1. **Censorship Resistance**

	•	Definition: Censorship resistance refers to the inability of any central authority or entity to prevent or block transactions within the Bitcoin network.
	•	Bitcoin’s Approach: Bitcoin’s decentralized structure, with thousands of nodes distributed globally, ensures that no single entity (government, bank, or corporation) can control or censor transactions. As long as someone has internet access and the ability to broadcast a transaction to the Bitcoin network, it will be processed and recorded on the blockchain.
	•	Impact: This characteristic allows Bitcoin to be used in environments where traditional financial systems may restrict access or block certain individuals or groups. It empowers individuals in authoritarian regimes or those facing economic sanctions by providing an alternative to state-controlled money.

2. **Dilutive Resistance**

	•	Definition: Dilutive resistance refers to Bitcoin’s resistance to inflationary pressures, particularly in terms of currency supply.
	•	Bitcoin’s Approach: Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. Unlike fiat currencies, where governments or central banks can print more money, thus diluting the value of existing money, Bitcoin’s supply is programmatically limited. This scarcity is enforced by the Bitcoin protocol and ensures that no more than 21 million Bitcoin will ever be created.
	•	Impact: Bitcoin’s predictable supply reduces the risk of devaluation from inflation, making it a potential store of value over the long term, especially in comparison to fiat currencies that can suffer from overissuance and inflation.

3. **Seizure Resistance**

	•	Definition: Seizure resistance refers to the difficulty or impossibility of an external entity forcibly taking control of one’s Bitcoin.
	•	Bitcoin’s Approach: Bitcoin is stored in digital wallets secured by private keys. Without the private key, no one can access the Bitcoin in that wallet. Because of this cryptographic security, Bitcoin ownership is difficult to seize, even by governments or law enforcement, unless the private keys are surrendered or compromised.
	•	Impact: This feature makes Bitcoin an appealing option for individuals living under authoritarian regimes or facing asset confiscation. It provides a layer of protection against government overreach, making it harder for authorities to freeze or confiscate funds, as can happen with traditional bank accounts.

4. **Permissionless**

	•	Definition: Permissionless means that anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network without needing approval from any central authority.
	•	Bitcoin’s Approach: Bitcoin operates as an open, decentralized system where anyone with access to the internet can send or receive Bitcoin, mine blocks, or run a node. There are no gatekeepers or intermediaries controlling access to the network.
	•	Impact: This characteristic is foundational to Bitcoin’s ethos of financial freedom. Unlike traditional financial systems that require permission (e.g., approval from a bank or government agency), Bitcoin enables anyone to participate, regardless of their geographic location, identity, or financial status. This has particular significance for unbanked populations or those excluded from the global financial system.

## Summary: Bitcoin’s Freedom Tech Nature

Bitcoin’s core features provide a powerful tool for individual sovereignty and financial independence:

	•	Censorship resistance ensures that no authority can block transactions or restrict access.
	•	Dilutive resistance protects holders from inflation by maintaining a fixed, scarce supply.
	•	Seizure resistance offers protection from asset confiscation due to its cryptographic security.
	•	Permissionless participation democratizes access to the financial system, removing traditional barriers.

These traits make Bitcoin a form of “freedom tech,” providing individuals with financial self-sovereignty, especially in contexts where traditional financial systems are oppressive or exclusionary.
