> Think of Bitcoin more like a metric system - like kilometers, miles, kilograms, liters. We need a measuring system in a hyper deflationary world where everything falls down significantly in price. That's where the finite supply of 21 million coins is beautiful. That's how you will finally have a metric system that will measure the unit of GDP account across the world.

This talk highlights the Sagun's vision of Bitcoin as a universal measuring tool for economic value in a world experiencing rapid technological deflation. It emphasizes Bitcoin's potential role not just as a currency or store of value, but as a fundamental unit of account in a transformed global economy.

   - Acts as a metric system in a deflationary world
   - Finite supply of 21 million coins helps measure economic activity
