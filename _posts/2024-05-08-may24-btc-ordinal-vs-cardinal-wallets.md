## ALERT
** Don't assume that I am subscribing to the idea of Orinal Inscriptions and Ordinal Wallets. This is my plight to understand the evolving space of Bitcoin in the year 2024. Also these are some interesting Bitcoin based Rust projects**

## Explain the idea of this statement: "Keep ordinal and cardinal wallets segregated" from Bitcoin Ordinals perspective

The statement "Keep ordinal and cardinal wallets segregated" from a Bitcoin Ordinals perspective relates to the management and usage of different types of Bitcoin wallets due to the introduction of Ordinals, which are a way to assign and track specific satoshis (the smallest unit of bitcoin, often abbreviated as sats) on the Bitcoin blockchain. Here's an explanation based on the broader context:

1. **Ordinals** - Ordinals refer to the concept of tracking individual sats through their history on the blockchain. This allows for the creation of what could be considered Bitcoin's version of NFTs or unique digital artifacts directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. These are often referred to as "ordinal inscriptions."

2. **Cardinal Wallets** - This term, while not universally standardized, can be inferred to mean traditional Bitcoin wallets that manage bitcoin as a fungible asset where each satoshi is considered equivalent to any other. These wallets are used for everyday transactions where the history or uniqueness of sats isn't considered.

3. **Ordinal Wallets** - These are wallets specifically designed or optimized for handling Ordinals. They might provide functionalities like inscribing data onto sats, tracking the provenance of specific sats, or managing them for their collectible or unique value rather than just their monetary worth.

## Segregation Rationale ##

- **Security and Complexity**: Managing ordinal inscriptions can introduce additional complexity and potential vulnerabilities. If you're dealing with Ordinals, you might engage in transactions or use features (like inscribing data) that are not typical for standard Bitcoin transactions. Keeping these activities separate from your main bitcoin holdings reduces risk.

- **Privacy and Anonymity**: Ordinal transactions might require different privacy considerations. Since each satoshi can be tracked, activities involving Ordinals could potentially link transactions more easily than standard Bitcoin transactions, affecting privacy.

- **User Experience**: Cardinal wallets are optimized for simplicity and efficiency in transactions. Introducing Ordinals, especially for users who might not understand or care about them, could complicate the wallet's interface and functionality. Segregation ensures that users only deal with Ordinals when they intend to, not by accident.

- **Asset Management**: If Ordinals gain significant value or cultural significance, keeping them separate allows for better asset classification. You might not want your collectible or high-value Ordinals mixed with regular spending funds.

- **Risk Management**: If there's ever an issue with Ordinal transactions (like bugs in wallet software handling inscriptions), limiting this functionality to specific wallets minimizes risk exposure for your main Bitcoin holdings.

- **Specialized Tools**: Wallets optimized for Ordinals might require different tools, APIs, or features. Segregation allows for the development and use of specialized tools without altering the primary functionality of standard Bitcoin wallets.

In essence, the advice to keep ordinal and cardinal wallets segregated is about managing risk, privacy, complexity, and asset types effectively on the Bitcoin network, reflecting the evolving nature of Bitcoin from a simple currency to a platform for more complex digital assets.
