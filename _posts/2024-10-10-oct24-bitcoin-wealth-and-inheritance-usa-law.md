# BTC Conference Amsterdam 2024

## Bitcoin Wealth and Inheritance

What are the Technical Challenges
    1. **Counterparty Risk** depending on nature of setup of Collaborative Custody and Mistakes in Sophistication setup
    2. **Education and Legacy** before death vs Post-Mortem Technical Challenge of Access 
    3. **Privacy and Security**: balance between setup safety vs lack of information when gone
    4. **Technical Insurance** - Why bitcoins can never be lost again from any wallets but only access can be delayed. 

## Legal Recognition and Taxation: Property Rights 
    1. KYC vs Non KYC ? What are the options in the market
    2. Assets in multiple jurisdictions (how to navigate international laws)
    3. Product and User Experience for Inheritance Wealth products: Simplicity on user side and abstracting complexity for safety and security

## Estate Planning Integration: Wills/Trust Standpoint Happen ? 
While Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (RUFADAA) doesn't explicitly address Bitcoin, its principles aim to facilitate the management of digital assets post-mortem by providing legal frameworks for fiduciaries

## Execution Details 
1. 5 Stage Process spanning over decades: (Setup → Periodic Health Checks → Upgrades/Rotation of Keys or Setup → Trigger →  Delivery → Legal Recourse)
2. Triggers of Confirmation Death: 
    A. These contracts would automatically verify conditions like the death of the owner through various oracles (services that provide real-world data to blockchains), which could include death registries, obituaries, or notifications from trusted parties.
    B. Manually verifying creates a dependency on a Single institution
