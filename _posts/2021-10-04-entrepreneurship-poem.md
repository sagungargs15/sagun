**CANDY = product, CANDY MACHINE = startup and CANDYMAN = team)** 

**â€”â€”START INFINITE LOOPâ€”â€”**

### meanwhile..the kid cried give me the **CANDY!!!** ^^

> hmm.. **CHOCOLATE** ^^^, thatâ€™s not **CANDY!!!** ..hmm..
  IF I **build** the candy machine, I get to **EAT ALL THE CANDY** ðŸ¤©

### meanwhile..the kid cried give me the **CANDY!!!** ^^

> hmm.. **DEVELOPER MACHINE** ^^^, thatâ€™s not **CANDY MACHINE** ..hmm..
  IF I **learn** the candy man, I can **CANDY THE CHOCOLATE** ðŸ¤©

### meanwhile..the kid  cried give me the **CANDY!!!** ^^

> hmm.. **HANDYMAN** ^^^, thatâ€™s not **CANDY MAN** ..hmm.. 
  IF I **re-build** the candy machine, I can **MAKE THE CANDY** ðŸ¤©

### meanwhile..the kid  cried give me the **CANDY!!!** ^^

**â€”â€”â€”  LOOP AGAIN â€”â€”**


> At the end of the day what matters? **Step1**: "Build -> Learn (Works?)" **Step2**: "Repeat step1" - said every Entrepreneur
 
- **3 Learnings from each verse**
  - **Verse1**: Itâ€™s backwards, build something customers want, build something you want as your own user (build for your own itch, eat your own dog food)
  - **Verse2**: Fail fast. Lack of product market fit reinforces pivoting your everything (candy the chocolate)
  - **Verse3**: Redo whatâ€™s not working in the startup: team, product & market (redo candymachine)
